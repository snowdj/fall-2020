# Attribution

Today's material is based on `r Citet(biblio,"mixtape2021")` and [lecture notes](https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalf20.classes.andrewheiss.com) by [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/)

I have adjusted the materials slightly to fit the needs and goals of this course

# Plan for the Day

1. What is a DAG?

2. How are DAGs useful?

3. What do familiar reduced-form causal models look like as DAGs?

4. How do we use a DAG to estimate causal effects with observational data?

# What is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)?

.pull-left[

- .hi[Directed:] Each node has an arrow that points to another node

- .hi[Acyclic:] You can't cycle back to a node; arrows are uni-directional
    - Rules out simultaneity

- .hi[Graph:] It's a graph, in the sense of discrete mathematical graph theory

```{r simple-dag, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3, out.width="100%"}
dagify(
  Y ~ X + Z,
  X ~ Z,

This DAG represents a model where $Z$ determines $X$ and $Y$, while $X$ also determines $Y$

- Graphical model of the DGP

- Use mathematical operations called $do$-calculus 

- These tell you what to adjust for to isolate and identify causality

- $do$-calculus is based on Bayesian Networks

# How to draw a DAG

e.g. .hi[What is the causal effect of an additional year of education on earnings?]

1. List variables

2. Simplify

3. Connect arrows

4. Use logic and math to determine which nodes and arrows to measure

---
# 1. List variables

- Education (treatment) → Earnings (outcome)

- (Many) other factors to consider
    - Location
    - Cognitive & non-cognitive abilities (incl. risk tolerance, delaying gratification, ...)
    - Demographics
    - Family socioeconomic status
    - Genetics
    - Birth cohort
    - Compulsory schooling laws
    - Employment network

---

# 2. Simplify

- Education (treatment) → Earnings (outcome)

    - Background (Demographics, Abilities, Genetics, Family SES)

    - Location

    - Birth cohort

    - Compulsory schooling laws

    - Employment network

---

2. .hi[Causation]

3. .hi[Collision]

# Other Resources

- Another great resource for DAGs is Nick Huntington-Klein's intro [slides](https://nickch-k.github.io/introcausality/Lectures/Lecture_16_Back_Doors.html)

    - These are geared towards a class that hasn't learned regression yet

    - There are helpful practice questions and examples

    - All about closing backdoors and going through frontdoors

- `r Citet(biblio,"huenermund2019")` has excellent details on $do$-calculus

    - Also discusses how to resolve the Structural vs. Reduced Form debate

---
# $do$-Calculus

- $do$-Calculus is the Bayesian Network math describing how to obtain causality

- We aim to obtain causality from .hi[observational data] using our DAG as the model

- And making as few parametric assumptions as possible
    - Our DAG generates a bunch of testable implications which we can use for validity
    - e.g. $Educ \perp Earnings \vert Background, Network$, ...

- The $do$-operator means setting the value of treatment to a specific value

- Written $\mathbb{P}[Y\vert do(X=x)]$ or $\mathbb{E}[Y\vert do(X=x)]$

- e.g. $\mathbb{E}[\log wage\vert do(educ=13)]$ (i.e. 1 year of college)

- $do(X=x)$ is graphically depicted by deleting all arrows leading into $X$

# Intuition of $do$-Calculus

- $do()$ is a causal operator, but we only have observational data

- $\mathbb{P}[Y\ |\ do(X)] \neq \mathbb{P}(Y\ |\ X)$

- So in order to estimate a causal effect, we need to get rid of the $do()$'s

- There are three formal rules, but there are also two special cases

1. Backdoor adjustment

2. Frontdoor adjustment

---
# Formal rules of $do$-Calculus `r Citet(biblio,"pearl2012")`

1. (Insertion/deletion of observations):
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(y\vert do(x), z, w) &= \mathbb{P}(y\vert do(x), w)
\text{ if } (Y \perp Z\vert X, W)G_{\overline{X}}
\end{align*}

2. (Action/observation exchange):
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(y\vert do(x), do(z), w) &= \mathbb{P}(y\vert do(x), z, w)
\text{ if } (Y \perp Z\vert X, W)G_{\overline{X}\underline{Z}}
\end{align*}

3. (Insertion/deletion of actions):
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(y\vert do(x), do(z), w) &= \mathbb{P}(y\vert do(x), w)
\text{ if } (Y \perp Z\vert X, W)_{\overline{X}\overline{Z(W)}}
\end{align*}
- $G_{\overline{X}}$ is the DAG with X "done" (all incoming arrows deleted)
- $G_{\underline{Z}}$ is the DAG with all outgoing arrows from $Z$ deleted
- $G_{\overline{X}\underline{Z}}$ is the DAG with $G_{\overline{X}}$ and $G_{\underline{Z}}$ applied

# Backdoor adjustment

\mathbb{P}[Y\ |\ do(X)] = \sum_Z \mathbb{P}(Y\ |\ X, Z) \mathbb{P}(Z)

- This is the definition of adjusting for $Z$

- This works because $Z$ is observed

- Our DAG presumes that there are no other confounders besides $Z$

# Frontdoor adjustment

       T ~ S,
       S ~ G,
       coords = list(
         x = c(S = 1, T = 2, C = 3, G = 2),
         y = c(S = 1, T = 1, C = 1, G = 2)
       ),
       labels = c(S = "Smoking", 
                  T = "Tar", 
                  C = "Cancer",
                  G = "Genetics"),
       exposure = "S",
       outcome = "C") %>%

  geom_dag_text() +
  geom_dag_label_repel(aes(label = label), nudge_y = 0.1, seed = 1234) +
  theme_dag()
```


- $S \rightarrow T$ is $d$-separated
- $T \rightarrow C$ is $d$-separated
- combine the effects to find $S \rightarrow C$

# Actually coding this up

- We don't have time to go through $do$-Calculus more thoroughly

- But you can consult `r Citet(biblio,"huenermund2019")` for more details

- You can also see an example from Andrew Heiss [here](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2020/02/25/closing-backdoors-dags/#comparison-of-all-methods)

- The R package `causaleffect` has many algorithms built-in

- Near as I can tell, no one has programmed these up in Julia yet

---
# Remaining issues

- DAGs seem really useful for understanding intuition

- I don't know how they deal with measurement issues

- They can't deal with simultaneity

- These issues might not actually be problematic, but I am unsure
